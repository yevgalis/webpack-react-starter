# General info
**`webpack-react-starter`** is a boilerplate intended for use in `React` projects. The main goal for creating it was the desire to understand how `webpack` works and how to use it alongside other modern instruments for web development.

> **NOTE:** *This bundle doesn't include `Redux` and `Typescript` as I don't use them yet. Maybe I'll add them later if necessary.*
